A TM experiments is conducted with P=2.7 D=0.1
- A chattering is observed for TM during late lifting or fast lowering-lifting transition
  -- A smaller P and a larger D
  -- A smaller delta_P compensation and adjustment of e
  -- Check the noisy level of the torque sensor

The feedback of torque sensor is smooth

The chattering of TM is eliminated by
  -- Set a smaller P and a larger D (P2/D0.2; P2.3/D1.3)
  -- The delta_P compensation and adjustment of e seems not as helpful as adjusting the PD parameters

When a smaller P is set for AM, chattering may also happened like (P2/D0.2; even P2/D1)
  -- A large P should be combined with a large D
  -- P1.8/D0.3 with delta_Ta 15 no P is effective without chattering

The compensation effect of AM is not working well for prototype operation with human subject
  -- The compensation of the inertia effect should be changed to a model-based term

A large P+D seems degrade the control effect from comparsion between P1.8/D0.3 and P2.4/D1
  -- The PD may set between this two like P2~2.2/D0.4~0.6

The walking is mis-classified as lowering
-- Add A threshold of HipDiffAngVel for standing --> lowering/walking
The Stoop is mis-classified Semi-squat
The Squat posture is hard to conduct and can easily turn to semi-squat during late/large bending
-- A trade-off between the tech classification timing and the difference of the features

It is observed shaking with P2.1/D0.5 and model-based compensation and the tracking effect is still not very good
Meanwhile, less shaking compared with very simple compensation
-- The P2.1/D0.5 can be adjusted more gentle like ~P1.9/D0.3 while the model-based motion compensation term should be precisly identified

The overcurrent error happened to left motor
-- A fine identified motion compensation term and a fine tuned PD controller
-- Maybe the P gain of the driver current PI controller should be further lower

The stride standing to lowering happen to happened but can not be detected at present
-- The logic of stride-->bending can be add in the future

The basic UID is tested for project review presentation, showing that the transition for assisted bending motion are not sensitive enough with large delay
