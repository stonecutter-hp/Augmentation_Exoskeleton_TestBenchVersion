At present the high-level and low-level controller are compacted in the MCU without upper computer
Logic: 
  Setup all the control parameters
  --> Sensor pre process to reset at expected initial position for sensor feedback initial value setup
  --> Pre-detection of user posture until Standing posture is comfirmed
  --> Running main func
  --> Sensor feedback update
  --> High-level control:  -> Yaw angle reset detection -> High-level sensor feedback processing -> UID -> RTG
  --> Low-level control 
  --> Send data to PC

  The interface for GUI function supporting is added for the controller
      To enable the GUI interface: upperControlFlag should be set as true in the MCU control program
  The GUI program only serves as data collection and visual UID testing and no UID and RTG strategies are implemented in it.
